The best movie I have watched this summer was probably Portrait Of A LAdy On Fire. Though I watcdhed it back in 2019, I just havent watched anything great this summer. I just bought it on the cineplex store and watched it.
The movie is about to females who fall in the with each other. One needs to paint a portrait of the other but, after spending time together they grow a bond.
