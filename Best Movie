The best movie I have watched this summer was probably Portrait Of A LAdy On Fire. Though I watcdhed it back in 2019, I just havent watched anything great this summer. I just bought it on the cineplex store and watched it.
Now this is why I like the movie. The movie is fantastic in every way. Every frame is a portrait, perfectkly shot in so many ways. It truely is a work of art that I admire so much.
